    <div id="starterpg">
        <p>Excalibur is the poster child for Warframe and the most commonly chosen option. He is versatile and has straightforward abilities, 
            giving easy access for new players while maintaining usefulness later in the game. He is most well known for his ability to summon
            an energy sword which can cleave hordes of enemies with ease. A great choice for players who love being in the middle of the action
            and hacking and slashing away at their enemies. <br />

        <tr>
            <th>Passive</th>
            <td>Excalibur gains 10% attack speed and damage with swords, dual swords, nikanas, and rapiers. Melee weapons are strong in the early game making this a solid passive for new players.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 1: Slash Dash</th>
            <td>Performs a dashing attack that damages enemies. Will link to multiple enemies automatically on hit. While not great for movement, it can be used similar to an extra jump.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 2: Radial Blind</th>
            <td>Creates a bright flash which blinds enemies for a short time and opens enemies up to finisher attacks. This is Excalibur's primary survivability tool and can stop rooms full of enemies in their tracks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 3: Radial Javelin</th>
            <td>Excalibur launches javelins towards enemies in a circle around him, dealing damage and temporarily stunning them. This ability tends to go unused as it has a high energy cost to use and the damage is underwhelming compared to using a combination of Excalibur's second and fourth abilities.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 4: Exalted Blade</th>
            <td>Excalibur summons a blade which replaces your melee weapon. It does high damage and sends out a projectile on swing that will pierce enemies. With the availability of strong melee mods early on, this ends up being a reliable damage source and only continues to get stronger as the game progresses.</td>

    <h2>Mag<br /></h2>
    <div id="starterpg">
        <p>Mag wields the powers of magnetism to crush enemies and bring the fight to her. She is a well rounded warframe with strong crowd control, 
            wide area damage abilties, strong survivability tools, and utility that makes her one of the strongest warframes for absolute top end content.
            She can be hard to use, but mastering her abilities is highly worthwhile. <br />
        </p>

<div id="startertable">
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Passive</th>
            <td>Mag has a magnetic field which pulls items to her in a nearby area. A great ability before players get access to pets, which can have the vacuum mod which overrides this passive.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 1: Pull</th>
            <td>Mag pulls enemies in front of her. This a great grouping ability that works well with melee weapons and any weapons which pierce enemies.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 2: Magnetize</th>
            <td>Tap to create a magnetic field around a target that draws in other enemies and pulls projectiles towards them. Hold to create a field that absorbs attacks and reflect damage back.
                The hold ability is rarely used, but the tap ability is one of the strongest end-game abilities in the game. To be able to group enemies is strong, but with weapons
                that pierce it can multiply damage output.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 3: Polarize</th>
            <td>Mag sends out a pulse that strips enemy armor and shields and restores her own shields and gives her polarize shards. Polarize shards are piercing projectiles that work
                very well with her second ability, allowing her to do high damage. The ability to restore shields is an invaluable defensive ability that is unique among the 3 starters.
                When shields break, warframes are immune for a short period, giving Mag the ability to survive by recasting her third ability during this invincibility period and
                giving her the potential of chaining these periods together. The ability to strip armor is also not found on either other starter, which allows mag to bypass the
                otherwise high defenses of certain enemies.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 4: Crush</th>
            <td>Mag uses her magnetic powers to crush the bones of nearby enemies, dealing damage, knocking them down, and restoring her own shields and those of nearby allies.
                This ability is highly versatile. The regeneration of shields is useful as stated in the discussion of the third ability, and the fact that it can also help allies
                simply adds to its utility. This also proves as effective crowd control with the knockdown effect and can kill some weaker enemies.

    <h2>Volt<br /></h2>
    <div id="starterpg">
        <p>Volt is the electric speedster of the group. He is the most versatile warframe of the three starters, offering damage buffs, speed boosts,
            and the potential for high damage <br />
        </p>

        <tr>
            <th>Passive</th>
            <td>Moving on the ground builds up a static charge which is released upon attacking an enemy. This is a small amount of bonus damage that is rarely felt.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 1: Shock</th>
            <td>Volt zaps an enemy with electricity, chaining to nearby enemies. The damage on this abilitiy is low and is only useful in the early game unless the <a href="https://wiki.warframe.com/w/Shock_Trooper">Shock Trooper</a> augment is installed.
                This allows this ability to also give a damage buff to your weapons, making it quite useful.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 2: Speed</th>
            <td>Volt grants increased speed to himself and nearby allies. This is a low cost way to increase mobility and is useful in all kinds of situations. A simple
                and versatile ability.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 3: Electric Shield</th>
            <td>Volt places a shield that can block projectiles and buffs allied projectiles which pass through it. This adds electricity damage to those projectiles along with
                increasing the damage on critical hit. Volt can also pick this shield up and move with it, being able to use the damage buff more efficiently. The combination
                of offense and defense on this ability makes it quite strong at all levels.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Ability 4: Discharge</th>
            <td>Volt releases an electric pulse that shocks nearby enemies and deals high damage over time. This stuns enemies, making it a solid crowd control tool, while
                also having the potential to clear rooms of enemies with ease. It also buffs Volt's first ability to deal damage in a small area instead of just to one target.
                This is especially powerful in early game where there are many weaker enemies.
